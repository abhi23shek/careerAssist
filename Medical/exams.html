            <h2>NEET (National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test)</h2>
            <p>NEET is the single entrance examination conducted by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) for admission to medical (MBBS) as well as dental (BDS) colleges across India, whether public, private, or deemed-to-be. As per the order of the Supreme Court of India in May 2016, NEET has effectively scrapped All-India Pre-Medical Tests (AIPMT) and all individual state-level medical entrance exams.</p>
            <p>NEET is an offline medical entrance exam containing 180 multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from PCB (Physics, Chemistry, Biology) concepts studied in Class 11 and 12. Until 2018, CBSE conducted the exam in offline mode. As of 2019, NEET is conducted by the National Testing Agency (NTA). The 3-hour long tests are held annually, usually during May.</p>

            <h2>JIPMER MBBS (Jawaharlal Institute Of Postgraduate Medical Education And Research MBBS Exam)</h2>
            <p>The JIPMER MBBS exam is a national-level medical entrance exam conducted annually by JIPMER, Puducherry. This exam offers admissions to 150 seats at the JIPMER Puducherry campus and 50 seats at the JIPMER Karaikal campus. More than 1.5 lakh aspirants apply for the online entrance exam.</p>
            <p>Since AIIMS and JIPMER are Institutes of National Importance (INI), they are out of the NEET ambit and conduct their own entrance examinations. JIPMER MBBS is a computer-based test with 200 objective-type questions (MCQs and reason assertive) from PCB subjects, English Language & Comprehension, and Logical and Quantitative Reasoning. The questions are based on the syllabus prescribed by the State and CBSE boards for Class 11 and 12.</p>

            <h2>AFMC (Armed Forces Medical College)</h2>
            <p>The Armed Forces Medical College (AFMC) offers education in the field of medicine and admits students to the MBBS course based on NEET Scores. AFMC provides admission to 130 MBBS seats, including 10 seats for SC/ST candidates (105 seats for boys and 25 seats for girls). Candidates can register online when the registration process starts.</p>

            <h2>PGIMER (Postgraduate Institute Of Medical Education And Research)</h2>
            <p>The Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) conducts one of the most competitive entrance examinations in India for PG medical courses. Similar to AIIMS PG and JIPMER PG, PGIMER is conducted twice a year in January and July sessions. PGIMER is an offline medical entrance exam with 250 questions and 3 hours as its duration. Since it's out of NEET PG's ambit, PGIMER conducts its own exams.</p>

            <h2>CMC Vellore</h2>
            <p>Christian Medical College (CMC) Vellore is a Christian minority educational college that offers admissions to students in various UG, PG, and diploma courses in the medical field. The authority releases the application form in an online format only. Admissions to MBBS courses are done based on entrance scores followed by an aptitude test set by CMC.</p>

            <h2>MU OET (Manipal University Online Entrance Test)</h2>
            <p>MU OET, now called MET, is an entrance test carried out by Manipal University. No separate entrance exam is conducted by the university for admission to medical courses. Admissions in PG medical courses are done through NEET PG, and MBBS & BDS admissions are given through MET scores.</p>
            <p>The application form for the MU OET 2024 exam is usually filled out online. It was made available from 11 December 2024, with the last date set on 10 April 2024, for phase I. The application form for phase II was available from 11 April 2024.</p>
