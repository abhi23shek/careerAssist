            <h2>PCM Subjects Class 11th</h2>
            <p>In Class 11, students have the option to choose between different streams, and PCM is one of the most popular choices among science students. Along with PCM subjects, students usually study a language subject and an elective subject. The PCM subjects for Class 11 are as follows:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Physics:</strong> Physics deals with the study of matter, energy, motion, and forces. Topics covered include mechanics, heat, thermodynamics, optics, and more.</li>
                <li><strong>Chemistry:</strong> Chemistry focuses on the composition, structure, properties, and reactions of substances. Students learn about elements, compounds, chemical reactions, and various branches of chemistry.</li>
                <li><strong>Mathematics:</strong> Mathematics involves the study of numbers, quantity, space, and patterns. Topics include algebra, trigonometry, calculus, coordinate geometry, and statistics.</li>
                <li><strong>English:</strong> English is a language subject that emphasizes communication, comprehension, and language skills.</li>
                <li><strong>Elective Subject:</strong> The elective subject could vary depending on the school or board of education. Common elective subjects in the PCM stream may include Computer Science, Biology, Economics, Physical Education, or other subjects.</li>
            </ul>
